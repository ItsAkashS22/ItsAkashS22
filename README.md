Hi, Iâ€™m Akash S ðŸ‘‹

A computer science enthusiast with a passion for technology, travel, and photography. I view computers and applications as a vehicle to inspire others to pursue their passions and enjoy the world around them.

In my early days, I started my computer science journey by learning C, C++, Java, Python.. And then expanded my skillset by learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, NodeJS, MySQL etc. Later learnt Flutter and started my career as Mobile Application Developer, with experience i became an Full Stack Mobile Application Developer and then started to develop and manage APIs, Web Applications and Mobile Applications. Now I'm a Complete Full Stack Developer with good knowledge of Data Structures and daily learning more things, getting updated to latest technology updates.

I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, So i'll always have something to strive towards. I'm not comfortable with settling, and I'm always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.
